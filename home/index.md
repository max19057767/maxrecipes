Groats, i.e. products obtained from cereal grains (completely or partially dehusked, and sometimes also ground), should be one of the main sources of carbohydrates in a balanced diet. One time of groats in particular - Buckwheat, is a very good source of protein. The complex carbohydrates groats can provide energy for a longer period of time, for instance, in comparison to the commonly used rice. Depending on the type of grain or pseudo-cereal the groats were made from, they are characterised by different content of minerals, vitamins and fibre. Among others, groats are rich in:

* Potassium
* Phosphorus
* Zinc
* Magnesium
* Iron
* B vitamins (B1, B2, B6)
