* 150g Frozen Mixed Fruit 
* 1 Cinnamon Stick

1. For the jam, put the dates in a pan with 150ml water, bring to the boil and stir well so they break down. 
2. Tip in the frozen fruit and cinnamon stick and cook over a medium heat, stirring every now and then for a couple of minutes. 
3. Don’t worry about fully thawing larger fruits, as they will defrost in the residual heat and retain their shape in the jam (if you have large strawberries in the mix, you can halve these as they soften). Once cooked, leave to cool. 
4. \
   Rinse the millet groats in a sieve. Place in a saucepan along with milk, a pinch of salt and vanilla extract. Cook over low heat until all the liquid is absorbed, about 10 - 15 minutes. 
5. Once cooked, leave covered for another 5 - 10 minutes.*
6. Serve a third of the porridge with a third of the compote, between two people.

##### Things to keep in mind:

∗ Cook the groats in the ratio of 1 cup of groats to 3 to 4 cups of liquid. The less liquid, the more perceptible and hard the groats. However, the more liquid we add, it begins to resemble creamy oatmeal.
