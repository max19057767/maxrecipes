#### The Benefits of Buckwheat:

Buckwheat groats are rich in unique exogenous amino acids - especially in lysine, which our body does not produce itself, but must be supplied with through food. Lysine is essential in building proteins, especially ones stored in muscles and bones. 

Buckwheat is a great source of protein (it contains approximately 10 to 16 percent). The protein from buckwheat is better absorbed than that derived from cereals, it has a similar value as legume protein. Buckwheat also regulates blood pressure and has potential anti-cancer effects.

2.

Cook the buckwheat groats with enough water to cover the groats in a saucepan, on a low heat for about 10 - 20 minutes.

Once cooked, leave covered for another 5 - 10 minutes.*



3.

Cut off the green leek leaves. Cut the white part in half lengthwise and rinse thoroughly. After, chop the leek into even smaller pieces.

5.

Peel the garlic and grate it on a fine grater.



6.

Pour a tablespoon of olive oil into the pan, put the shrimps with half the garlic, fry briefly on each side for about half a minute. Season with salt and pepper, set aside on a plate.

7.

Pour an additional tablespoon of olive oil into the same pan, add the leek and cook, stirring, for about 3 minutes.

8.

Add the cubed zucchini and paprika, mix and fry for about 5 minutes. At the end, add the rest of the garlic, season with salt, pepper and hot paprika.



9.

Add groats, mix and fry for 2 minutes, add shrimps and parsley, mix and heat together for about 1 minute.



**Things to keep in mind:**

∗ Cook the groats in the ratio of 1 cup of groats to 3 to 4 cups of liquid. The less liquid, the more perceptible and hard the groats. However, the more liquid we add, the groats will be soft and tender.
